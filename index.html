      <p>
        One better than another is being sold. <span class="p-reference">(referring to the officials at different levels)</span>.The money has caused distances among the friends The ones writing are not men. <span class="p-reference">(referring the newswriters / journalists, how they have been making news stories out of anything)</span>. They write only for the money What to say about the beauties? Nowadays there are fake bodies <span class="p-reference">(referring to plastic surgery transformations)</span>. The lips, the butt, the hair even eyes. The girls have made it fashion  <span class="p-reference">(to have fake body parts)</span>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        You have yours and I have mine .People have dark hearts like dark nights .Not everybody values the hard-work .Only he knows who has got has hands dirty working really hard .Another thing, there is no happiness around .There is no respect for parents .What is the importance of having father in life .Ask one who has lost both his parents .Even smartness is required to copy  <span class="p-reference">(cheat in exams)</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beauty of heart is above the beauty of face. The needy ones who don’t even have enough to get slippers are happier  <span class="p-reference">(tension-less)</span> than richest. Why it is said that being in relationship with girl before marriage is bad?. And she is mocked among friends buy them. The girl who rejects the proposals and doesn’t show interest. That’s the reason, she is defamed. Where is real mother? if cow is to called mother. The one gave birth has been forgotten after fake-beliefs. Not mother, The cow is worshiped here instead. Even people have been making business out of cow urine. I don’t say that I’m the wisest. I’m just twenty-one years old young man. Before leaving, father taught me that only take what’s your right to

        The poet  <span class="p-reference">(Karan Aujla)</span> is truly a mystical person .The way my life is now, it is at it’s best. There is no greed for money .Each word in this song is right from heart .My only competition is with my fate .My slang is rap itself .If the person next to one falls, others clap on it.  <span class="p-reference">(enjoy to see one falling)</span>.
      .If a friend uses abusive language for another friend .It’s nothing less than slapping a friend .The God doesn’t reside in totems .The storm points at the existence of The Lord .As it was mentioned in sayings from history. I have never spotted that God.

        The ones love women can’t fulfill what brotherhood takes. The dogs of riches don’t sleep hungry. The kings have their guns to be fired by wazirs <span class="p-reference"> (minister)</span>. No-one is afraid of his end. The opponents have always been the first to attack. No-one is afraid of his end. The opponents have always been the first to attack. At last, they are all buried under same ground. Even butcher or a saint.

        See, without Mom and Dad, where I have reached today. Where I stand today. I have come alone, on my own. I have equally earned and lost. I seek my mother’s shadow in her pictures. Mother was dearest. Money is not. That’s why I have told you, my friends. Spend time with your parents. I wanted to see my parents but I couldn’t. Wanted to see them but I could never.
